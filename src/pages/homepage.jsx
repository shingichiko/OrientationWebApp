            <p>
              Hey, are you ready for your 1st week of University? If not, this
              website will guide you through what the Uni life has to offer,
              from learning the campus layout to an enhanced understanding of
              the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is jam packed full of information to help you trough
              your first week at Newcastle University, no matter your degree
              i.e. NewStart, Information Tech, Medicine, commerce, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              During your first week here at Newcastle Uni, 1st year students
              will be welcomed with open arms and encouraged to explore the
              campus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the year there are events that take place around the
              Uni, a good one to keep an eye out for is the UON Sausage Watch
              where you can score yourself a free sausage sizzle and meet new
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              A glorified version of these kinds of events are showcased during
              the Orientation Week, which we encourage you go to for a great
              time. More information on O Week throughout the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, students can learn a lot from the O Week, utilising
              this time to look around campus and obtaining their Student ID
              Cards.
            </p>
            <p>
              These cards can be found at the Students Services Building,
              allowing students to have access to certain buildings/rooms where
              allocated i.e. an IT student having access to the Engineering
              computer rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Student Services Building also has a wide variety of help
              desks for any questions you may have, like asking about a courseâ€™s
              financial penalty census date. More information in the 'Student
              Card' tab.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are other buildings around campus like the libraries, food
              courts and chaplaincy where students can meet new people, discuss
              topics, and get advice.
            </p>
            <p>
